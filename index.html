								<h1>Hi. We are <strong>Group 37</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p>And this is our project, <strong>An Analysis on the Supposed Rise in EDSA Revolution dis/misinformation during the 2022 election period</strong>. As data science students from the University of the Philippines, we aim to gather pertinent data about the allegations involving the EDSA revolution from tweets spanning from 2016-2022. Using these data and our knowledge in machine learning, we hope to make an analysis that can help elucidate the situation about the rampant spread of mis/disinformation on Twitter.</p>

								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>In light of the recent change in the EDSA holiday's date, we are interested in knowing how people perceive the historical significance of the EDSA revolution and how the rise of mis/disinformation has affected the amount of skepticism about its legitimacy and validity.</p>

								<h3>Problem</h3>
								<p>As social media platforms become much accessible to the mass people, it has become a means for some people to distribute wrong information for their own benefit or sometimes they are just misinformed too. This has caused a rise in misinformation and disinformation regarding many fields including medicine, politics, and even history itself.</p>

		<!-- Data Collection -->
			<article id="data" class="wrapper style2">

						<h2>We mined the internet for fake news data.</h2>
						<p>After the formulation of our topic, we scoured through Twitter to look for tweets containing mis/disinformation</p>
					</header>
					<div class="row aln-center">
						<div class="col-12">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h3>Mode of Collection</h3>
								<p>We collected our data manually by using Twitter's advanced search and browsing through all tweets looking for potential mis/disinformation. After collecting all these suspected tweets, we manually picked out those tweets that really give mis/disinformation, we then manually encoded the tweet data to our dataset one by one.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h3>Dates of Collection</h3>
								<p>We collected tweets on two batches. The first batch or the first 100 tweets are collected from March 22 to March 30 of the year 2023. The second batch on the other hand, was all collected on April 18, 2023.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h3>Data Selection Criteria</h3>
								<p>The data collected are fact-checkable and not mere opinions. They adhere to the following standards: <br>
									<b>Is it a statement of fact? </b><br>
									<b>Is it relevant?</b><br>
									<b>Is it feasible to verify using reliable sources?</b><br>
In order to gather tweets on the subject, we looked into the topic of "EDSA revolution legitimacy and the alleged downfall of the Philippines after it." To do this, we used keywords like "fake edsa," "EDSA revolution economy," "edsa fake revolution," and "EDSA, peke." To be considered relevant to the issue, tweets had to be posted between 2016 and 2022. Additionally, we ensured that each tweet is distinct, therefore we do not include retweets as unique tweets.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h3>Sample Size Collected</h3>
								<p>We collected a total of 442 sample tweets.</p>

						<h2>Here's what we found out.</h2>
						<p>We applied statistical methods and machine learning methods applicable to time series analysis in order to help us explore the data. This includes peak detection, change point detection and linear regression.</p>

					<div class="row">

								<h3><a href="#">Peak Detection</a></h3>
								<p>Time Series analysis examines a series of data points over a period time. In this study, we examine data from 2016-2022. The figure above highlights the peaks observed in our data.</p>
							</article>

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/changepdetection.png" alt="" /></a>
								<h3><a href="#">Change Point Detection</a></h3>
								<p>According to our findings, there is a significant peak in number of tweets around 2021-02, 2022-02, and 2022-06. Furthermore, a change point is observed in the Change Points plot. We took note of the dates within each timeframe.<br />
								<br />
								Based on our research and observations, these dates are relevant to significant events that relate to our research question. The observable events from the dates are the following:</p>
								<ol>
									<li> Bongbong Marcos declared his candidacy for president[1]: In October 2021, Bongbong Marcos filed his candidacy for the Philippine presidency in 2022. This sparked controversy among the public as can be seen on various social media platforms. This prompted mention of the EDSA Revolution among Twitter users. </li>
									<li> EDSA Revolution Anniversary: In commemoration of the historical event, the People Power Revolution is celebrated as a holiday every year. Therefore, it resurfaces every February in remembrance. Our findings show that it garnered the most engagement in 2021 and 2022. </li>
									<li>  The 2022 campaign period[2]: The presidential election took place on May 9, 2022, but the campaign began three months prior, in February 2022. Social media was used to resurface issues, including the EDSA Revolution, during the campaign to support the people's preferred candidates. As a result, more tweets were posted during this time period. </li>
									<li> Premiere of 'Maid In Malacañang'[3]: In July 2022, Daryll Yap announced that his film 'Maid in Malacañang' would premiere in August 2022. The announcement received a generally negative response, with certain scenes spurring controversy over misrepresentations of history. Meanwhile, it was promoted in Twitter by a number of people who supported the film. </li>

									 <br />
									The statistical model used is t-test between the linear predictor values to test for a significant change in the number of tweets between the said period. T-test is also used on the mean number of tweets on the said periods to test whether there is a significant rise to the tweets. Both of these tests saw a significant rise on the number of tweets between time periods.</p>
